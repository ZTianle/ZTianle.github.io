Randomly initializing the weight between the input layer and the hidden layer and the threshold of each hidden layer neuron, the weight matrix of the hidden layer can be calculated by the least squares method. The efficient learning ability in ELM makes it widely applicable in classification, regression, and more. However, owing to some unutilized information in the residual, there are relatively huge prediction errors involving ELM. In this paper, a deep residual compensation extreme learning machine model (DRC‐ELM) of multilayer structures applied to regression is presented. The first layer is the basic ELM layer, which helps in obtaining an approximation of the objective function by learning the characteristics of the sample. The other layers are the residual compensation layers in which the learned residual is corrected layer by layer to the predicted value obtained in the previous layer by constructing a feature mapping between the input layer and the output of the upper layer. This model is applied to two practical problems: gold price forecasting and airfoil self‐noise prediction. We used the DRC‐ELM with 50, 100, and 200 residual compensation layers respectively for experiments, which show that DRC‐ELM does better in generalization and robustness than classical ELM, improved ELM models such as GA‐RELM and OS‐ELM, and other traditional machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and back‐propagation neural network (BPNN).","tags":[],"title":"A deep residual compensation extreme learning machine and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianle Zhang","Muzhou Hou","Tao Zhou","Zhaode Liu","Weirong Cheng","Yangjin Cheng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603693413,"objectID":"c07f6262dc42d64a9300b671b683ad87","permalink":"https://ZTianle.github.io/publication/zhang-2020-land/","publishdate":"2020-10-26T06:23:33.632248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2020-land/","section":"publication","summary":"Classifying land-use scenes with high quality and accuracy is an important research direction in current hyperspectral remote sensing images, which is conducive to scientific management and utilization of land.

Less than 20% of all landslides are predictable each year, so a simple, fast, reliable and low-cost method to predict the stability of slopes is urgently needed. This study investigates a new regularized online sequential extreme learning machine, incorporated with the variable forgetting factor (FOS-ELM), based on intelligence computation to predict the factor of safety of a rock slope (F). The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is applied to establish seven input combinations based on the parameters of the Hoek-Brown criterion and geometrical and mechanical parameters of the slope, such as the geological strength index (GSI), disturbance factor (D), rock material constant ($m_{i}$), uniaxial compressive strength ($σ_{ci}$), unit weight of the rock mass ($Y$), slope height (H) and slope angle (β). Seven models are established and evaluated to determine the optimal input combination. Various statistical indicators are calculated for the prediction accuracy examination. Compared to the classical extreme learning machine (ELM) model predictions of F, the results of the applied FOS-ELM model demonstrate a better prediction accuracy and are more effective when accounting for an increase in data. The FOS-ELM model with all seven input parameters is used to establish stability charts with the influence coefficient of slope angle change ($η_{β}$), disturbance change ($η_{D}$) and slope height change ($η_{H}$). Using stability charts with a combination of $η_{β}$, $η_{D}$ and $η_{H}$ can be used to quickly and preliminarily analyze rock stability as a guide for engineering practitioners in rock slope design.","tags":[],"title":"Rock slope stability analysis and charts based on hybrid online sequential extreme learning machine model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongli Sun","Muzhou Hou","Yunlei Yang","Tianle Zhang","Futian Weng","Feng Han"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603693412,"objectID":"1c1418d4007ba69dea799670bd10a248","permalink":"https://ZTianle.github.io/publication/sun-2019-solving/","publishdate":"2020-10-26T06:23:32.615874Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2019-solving/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce a new method based on Bernstein Neural Network model (BeNN) and extreme learning machine algorithm to solve the differential equation.

We propose to use a generalized regularized online sequential extreme learning machine with forgetting factor (GR-OSELM-FF) for voice activation detection to adapt to the difference between test and training samples. Practical usability is our driving motivation; the proposed model should be easily adapted to new conditions. When a new voice stream arrives in the test or the actual application phase, the proposed model can directly adjust the output weight. To overcome the weakness of ELM's vulnerability to random hidden layer parameters, we use an extreme learning machine-based autoencoder (ELM-AE) to initialize the model parameters instead of using random initialization. The experimental results show that the pretrained models achieve better performance with ELM-AE, which can obtain the potential information from the data. The experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm maintains good accuracy and omission rates in different SNR noise environments and real-world voice samples.","tags":[],"title":"An Online Learning Algorithm for Voice Activation Detection Based on a Pretrained Online Extreme Learning Machine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Futian Weng","Muzhou Hou","Tianle Zhang","Yunlei Yang","Zheng Wang","Hongli Sun","Hao Zhu","Jianshu Luo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603693413,"objectID":"5955d267160110dc161b8a88601b9fad","permalink":"https://ZTianle.github.io/publication/weng-2018-application/","publishdate":"2020-10-26T06:23:33.341124Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weng-2018-application/","section":"publication","summary":"Forecasting international iron ore is a well-known issue, BIC criterion is used to select the relevant variables of iron ore price.
